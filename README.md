# LeetCodeGo

This repository contains solutions to algorithm problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), implemented in **Go**. The goal of this project is to practice problem-solving and improve skills in data structures and algorithms, using Go for efficient, modern coding.

## Purpose

- **Learn**: Improve logic, optimization skills, and advanced programming techniques.
- **Share**: Provide solutions to LeetCode problems and collaborate with other developers.
- **Consolidate**: Apply concepts of data structures and algorithms in Go while enhancing performance in technical challenge solving.

## Project Structure

Each directory contains solutions for a specific problem, including:
- The original problem statement (documented in code comments).
- The optimized and tested solution.
- Explanations of the approach taken.

Additionally:
- Each solution is accompanied by a test file located in the same folder, following Go's testing framework.
- You can run the tests to verify that the solution works correctly.
- Feel free to provide different inputs (payloads) to test various edge cases.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Golang
- **Paradigms**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Optimization
- **Tools**: LeetCode for problem-solving practice

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
